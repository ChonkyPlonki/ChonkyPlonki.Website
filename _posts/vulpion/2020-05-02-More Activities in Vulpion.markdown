description: In the photo above you see the pottery-making mechanic I was working on. <br> I overscoped and designed/started implementing many mechanics that had to be cut. In hindsight I can see that many of these mechanics could be games in and of themselves and it would be better to scope down. I show some of these activities below! Not all of them were cut, but most were.

    description: "There's an old game called Dark Cloud 2 that has a really endearing mechanic where you can research and invent new recipes with the photos you've taken of the world.
