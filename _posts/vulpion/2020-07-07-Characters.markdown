description: I made various characters for Vulpion. I wanted to make a mix of Vulp and human characters. One of my favorite characters I made was the bejewled Vulp in the middle, he was supposed to be the most beautiful Vulp in all of Vulpion and perform songs in the starting city every Saturday.

    label: Omne and Plonks, a couple
    description: "This is a couple in Vulpion. They are an alien species and have shapes across their nose and cheeks. I specifically wanted to make an alien desirable female couple that had 'alien' features that don't make them 'more' conventionally attractive. I've often found that alien woman that are portrayed in positive lights get 'alien features' that make them 'more conventionally attractive'. Taller, thinner waists, abnormally large eyes (like avatar) etc. So I wanted to go against that!"
