description: I wanted to create animal-interactive mechanics that weren't violent, but would rather mimic how we bond and have relationships with people in real life. I find non-violent mechanics super interesting and would love to explore them more. So for this game, instead of hitting animals/monsters you would Dazzle, Apologize, Listen, Establish Boundaries and be Patient with them, to name a few interactions. You'll find some more examples in the gallery below!

    label: Sketch of Bonding Actions
    description: "This is a sketch I made of various bonding actions the player could do. It was hard to conceptualize making subtle relationship-actions we do in a visually strong way that would fit in a game, I especially struggled with the 'vulnerability'. I orginally played with the idea of including very unhealthy behaviours (such as the murder-skill or dominance skill) so the player could chose and explore various behaviours. But I decided against it, it didn't feel right!"
