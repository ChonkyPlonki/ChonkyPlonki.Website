description: For the dialog system I experimented with various looks, sounds and structures. I wanted the portraits to be animated and show various emotes (which adds significant scope). I also explored having a little "emote"-internal dialog that would pop up when the player was feeling certain things. You can see more in the gallery below. <br> I also played with having individual sounds for all letters of the alphabet to play when the characters spoke, a little like Animal Crossing. In the video below you can hear this effect.

    label: Customized Portraits
    description: "As the player can be customized the portraits needed to be customized as well. In this gif you can see me toggling between a short snout and a long snout testing the solution, so that the snout would correspond to the choice the player made."
