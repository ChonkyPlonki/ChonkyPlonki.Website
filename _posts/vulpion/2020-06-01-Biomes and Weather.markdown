description: I adore 'odd' colors, strange looking plants, water in all colors and shimmering, holographic effects. So I wanted to incorporate these aspects into Vulpion's biomes. The image above shows the six different biomes in Vulpion. When I painted and designed these, one of the things I thought of was that I wanted the biomes to look very different from one another, and so they all have distinct color-schemes. Additionally, I wanted to move away from classical biomes that are common in games (like snow, rocky, grassy, desert etc.). I love classical biomes, however I thought there were a lot of interesting new biomes and aspects to explore.

    label: Weather
    description: "I love the idea of exploring new types of weather, Imagining weather phenomena that may exist on other planets. So I designed the weather phenomena above for Vulpion. Unfortunately, I never got to implementing the bubble fog."
