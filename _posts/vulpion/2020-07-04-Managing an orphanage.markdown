description: Real life can be so overwhelming and hard. I personally have a deep desire to help others in meaningful ways and at the same have become hurt by doing more than I could before. And so in this game I wanted to add a mechanic where you could just do good and take care of others that needed it and make things well. Where things are simpler, and you have resources to help people around you and can make safe lives for them. So the idea was that you found baby animals in the world, and could make homes for them with you, reunite them with friends and family, help them get therapy, feed them, and just make things well and safe. See more details below.
