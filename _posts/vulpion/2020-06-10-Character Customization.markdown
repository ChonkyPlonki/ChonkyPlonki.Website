description: This game was a one woman passion project that began in September 2019. I had for a couple of years been obsessed with making a game that reflected a healthy society, modeled a little after current Scandinavian social systems. I wanted to portray a civilization with ample access to free mental health care professionals, focus on inclusivity, free education, welfare programs and compassionate leadership. <br>

description1: The idea was to explore the difficulties and excitements in such societies, despite the ample support systems. To dive into (from my perspective) a mostly untapped genre - games that focus on solving conflicts we encounter every day in more behaviourally realistic, non-violent ways. <br> <br>What can we do to feel included? How do we bond socially with others? How can we help someone who is unwell while also taking care of ourselves? Which way can we handle our interpersonal conflicts? These are very difficult questions with complicated and nuanced answers. Therefore, they're such interesting concepts to explore in games to me! ðŸ’š
