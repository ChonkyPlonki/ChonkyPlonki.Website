    label: Equipment
    description: "This gif shows as I was working on the equipped bag and how it would look as the character rotated. Each equipment-item had to be painted in 5 angles (up, upper left, left, lower left, down) to get the character to be able to do a smooth 360 rotation. The upper left, left and lower left images were mirrored to the the right-side of the rotation."
