description: I wanted to make the world "open world" (in hindsight that wasn't a great decision as it introduces a massive amount of scope). I played around with various ways to do this. I tested out Unity's WorldStreamer, then tried building the world in 3D (see gif above) and ultimately settled for using the Unity 2D tilemap-system and splitting the world into squares that would load as you approached them.
