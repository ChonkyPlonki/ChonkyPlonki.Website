  Although we initially planned to finish the game in only 1 month, we extended that to 2 months (doubling dev time) as it proved too short a time to develop even this small game. In the process of fitting the scope of the game into such a short time-frame we ended up cutting lots of features and art that we had planned. The image above shows one such things, the maffia duck, which we had to cut because adding more ducks caused balancing to be harder, and didn't fit the time frame. Originally this duck was supposed to make other ducks quack louder.

    description: "We originally had planned for three different ponds in the game, one among them the cozy old lady's bathtub seen above. In the end we had to cut two of the three ponds from the game for scope reasons, so the bathtub (seen in this gif) ended up not being included in the game."
