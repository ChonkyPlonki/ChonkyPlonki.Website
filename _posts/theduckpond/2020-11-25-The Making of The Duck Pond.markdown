description: This game-projected started during The Nordic Game Jam 2024. Jonathan Herz made a prototype of the duck game where you could throw food in a pond and ducks would pop up. We both liked the prototype, even in its very basic form and decided to make a fully fledged game out of it. The gif above shows one of the early prototypes when we considered having ducks perpetually fix the screen until they filled everything. We loved this but it produced performance issues and we had to drop it (see more in performance section).<br>

    label: Time Spent On Creation
    description: "We worked on the game while working full-time jobs. It was incredibly intense. We both timed exactly how many hours we put into creating/marketing/planning the game, and in the end I personally spend 435 hours on the game from start to finish. I even took a week off from work, just to be able to work on it in a more focused way. The above image was the winning-screen before we implemented the true cut-scene ending! "

    description: "The image above shows the week I took off from work to work on The Duck Pond more intensely, and the hours I tracked for the work that week. It was taxing and I don't think I recommend this after the fact!"
