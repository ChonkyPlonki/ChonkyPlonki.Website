  Jonathan Hertz did all balancing in the game and did an incredible job! 
  To easily adjust the ducks' idle numbers and see what consequences changing them and balancing them would have over time he made the excel-sheet depicted in the image above. The excel sheet has the ducks' effects boiled down to numers plotted over time. It also includes calculations that will automatically update the values if you change the idle-coin production the ducks yield. This excel sheet was invaluable as we did playtests and found the speed of unlocks too fast or too small!
