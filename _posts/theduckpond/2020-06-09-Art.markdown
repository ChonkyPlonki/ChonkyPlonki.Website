  The art went through several iterations, and as we scoped down the game we also cut much of the art that was painted. The image above depics one of the scenes we kept, the main duck pond, and how it went from first color-sketch for final art. 
  <br> Below you'll find more about the art in the game.

    description: "This is a photo of the sketches I made for the scenes and how we could set them up. You can for example see the main menu sketch at the top left, and the various ponds at the bottom (two of those had to be cut for scope reasons)! At the bottom you can see the sketch of the intro to the game."
