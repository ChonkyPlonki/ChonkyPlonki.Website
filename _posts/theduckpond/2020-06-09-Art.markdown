  I love making beautiful water in games, it is one of my favorite things! So for Vulpion I set out to do that. I also wanted to capture that peaceful feeling one can get when diving in real life. Some of the ways I did that was by:

  - Obscure everything above land with a dark overlay.
  - Tint the colors to sea green.
  - Add a filter to the music.

  In this game, both the water surface and the underwater surface are set up in similar ways:
  
  - First, there's a sprite that holds just one color
  - Layered on top of that are images of water-like patterns that have a shader on them causing the patterns to sway
  
  See the image below to see how the water is structured visually.

    description: "I wanted the edge of the water to look soft, so I made translucent sprites with a sin-wave shader to portray a soft water edge. You can see this in the gif where the edge of the water slowly rolls against the grass."

    description: "This is a gif of as I was animating the player's underwater swimming animation. The animations are done with Unity's 2DAnimation tool, it's awesome! Here I am also testing the equipment system by equipping a skirt 'under water'"

    label: How walking into water works
    description: 
     Because the game is in 2D and I didn't want to use 3D terrain I needed to figure out a way to have the player 'sink' into the water as the player walks out into it. I ended up using a heightmap (that's hidden to the player) that pushes the player's position up or down depending on if it's walking over white on the height map (up) or black (down). In the gif above you can see the Vulp-player bump up and down depending on the color of the texture it."

    label: Alternative color scheme
    description: "In one biome I wanted the water to have this deep green almost brownish color that reminds me of Swedish rich forests. I find this color scheme for cozy forests rarely used in games/media - but I find it so beautiful and calming! This image is concept art I made for that type of water for Vulpion."
