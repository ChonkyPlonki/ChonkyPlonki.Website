description: I wanted the game to feel relaxing and a little silly, so I painted its color scheme in soft colors inspired by Swedish forests. Additionally I made the main character, the fox, very simplistically painted. Both because it's endearing and because it's easier to make more art of if needed (like simple clothes etc.)
