  I have a tendency to scope creep and work to add lots of mechanics that I just love into all my projects. I added several mechanics to Chonkymon that I had to cut for scope reasons.

    label: Scrap Booking Insect Gathering
    description: "I like pretty books, and pretty water captured in non-traditional items. I also love capturing insects in games like Stardew Valley. So, I just decided to mash all those things together and conceptualize an insect-gathering mechanic where you capture them in this book rather that using a net. Writing it out makes me realize it's a little crazy haha."

    label: Aquarium
    description: "I wanted an aquarium in the game that looked like a pie with transparent filling, so I added that. This is a collage-sketch of that I put together with various images online just to test the concept out."
