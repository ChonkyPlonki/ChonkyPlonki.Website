  For this game, to maintain scope, I only include two npc characters. They are Sploot and Borba which you can read more about below.

    label: Sploot
    description: "Sploot is a rude, blue, glittery capybara that appears on the island when the player lands on it. He loves shimmery things and has a golden show on his head. This image shows a collage-sketch of him I made early on."

    label: Plonks
    description: "Plonks is the main character in this game. I love her! I put her in almost all my games. She's an old lady and a scientist. She's also kind."

    label: Borba
    description: "Borba is the monster love interest in the game. Many games do romance in fun and interesting ways with fun characters. I've rarely seen visibly old women be desirable and romancable in games, however - so I wanted to add one myself! And so Borba was made."
